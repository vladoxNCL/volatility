# Transparency Through Volatility

This is the Jupyter notebook containing the experiments we performed on volatility on the EPSRC CDT in Cloud Computing for Big Data at Newcastle University.

In order to run these experiments locally, you need an up-to-date version of Python 3, together with several
data analysis libraries. Easiest way to get everything setup is probably to install Anaconda.

If you just want to browse through the results, click on *volatility_analysis.ipynb*.
